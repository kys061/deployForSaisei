[Introduction]

    ezio_300_api package is a sample control 2*16 EZIO utility.
  
    ezio_340_api package is a sample control 2*16 EZIO utility. Besides the
design of five buttons, other commands are same with EZIO-300.

    ezio_g500_api package is a sample control 128*64 graphic LCD device utility. 

[General Description]

    The ezio_300_api can create a customized pattern by the command -p.
The usage is setted as following: ezio_300_api -d [device] -p [Information].
The [Information] includes the save address, and the pattern data of the eight rows.
For example, the pattern is created as below.

Address: 03
Customized pattern:
				43210
			0 	XXXXX 	---1F
			1 	XXXX.	---1E
			2 	XXX.. 	---1C
			3 	XX... 	---18
			4 	X.... 	---10
			5 	....X 	---01
			6 	...XX 	---03
			7 	..XXX 	---07

  The 'X' means bright points and the '.' means blank ones.
There are eight address (00 to 07) can be used to save customized patterns.
The row 0 is 'XXXXX' which means '11111' in binary and '1F' in hexadecimal format.
This example can be created by the following command:

		ezio_300_api -d [device] -p "031F1E1C1810010307"

Finally, this pattern is created in address 03.

[Sample LCD Daemon]
    In this package, an simple LCD daemon as sample program to utilize the EZIO API (for EZIO-300) is provided. The daemon provides rolling menu with time display, reboot, and shutdown features to show basic display and button functions of the EZIO module.

    1. Build sample LCD Daemon.

       # cd <path of utility>/src/sample/lcdd

       # make

    2. The executive file "lccd" is generated in "bin". Please execute the program as daemon.

       # ./bin/lcdd /dev/ttyS1 &

[Use this sample in Linux OS (non-FreeBSD)]
    1. Build all EZIO APIs
       # cd <path of utility>

       # make

    2. The all EZIO APIs are generated in "bin". Please execute the sample utility.

       # cd bin
       # ./ezio_380_api -d [device] [command]
         EX: Clear screen of EZIO
         >> ./ezio_380_api -d /dev/ttyS1 -c

[Use this sample in FreeBSD]
    1. Build all EZIO APIs
       # cd <path of utility>

       # make CC=clang
        
    2. The all EZIO APIs are generated in "bin". Please execute the sample utility.

       # cd bin
       # ./ezio_300_api -d [device] [command]
         EX: Clear screen of EZIO
         >> ./ezio_300_api -d /dev/cuau1 -c
